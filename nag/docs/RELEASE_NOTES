The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Nag Task List
Manager version H4 (3.0).

Nag is a web-based application built upon the Horde Application Framework which
provides a simple, clean interface for managing online task lists (i.e., todo
lists). It also includes strong integration with the other Horde applications
and allows users to share task lists or enable light-weight project management.

To install Nag, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install Nag with the following command:

  pear install horde/nag

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 (3.0-RC2) are:

    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The major changes compared to the Nag version H4 (2.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4.
    * New Ajax frontend (through Kronolith).
    * System task lists.
    * Task list coloring.
    * Quick task adding.
