====================================
 Kolab_Format Development TODO List
====================================

 - Type handlers left to do:

   - Dates

   - Recurrences

   - pure XML

 - Type handler _params should be splitted to instance parameters and
   options changing per-run.

 - cleanup Xml.php

 - Provide the Root.php with the means to do all further processing.

 - Allow the Root.php handler to be extended with application specific
   attributes on the fly

 - create handler instances just once

 - better internal api version support

 - cleanup handlers.

 - Remove the use of the Horde_Date class from testing. It should be
   no problem to get the same code coverage without using the external
   class.

 - Do not overwrite anything from other clients.

 - Think about storing the data in iCal format.

 - Check how we deal with malformed XML data

 - KEP2

 - AllDay events

 - Recurrence start handling

 - Check kolab/issue4672 (Kolab_Format has encoding problems)
